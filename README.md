# loan_status_prediction
This is a classification problem to predict the 'loan_status' of client using 18 available features. Here I implemented various machine learning algorithms including ensemble learning with the best practices (e.g., k-fold cross-validation, grid search, pipeline, f1_score, etc.). This is a fun Data Science project.
